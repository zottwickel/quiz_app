# quiz_app

This is a quiz app designed and implemented as part of the Thinkful coding bootcamp. I decided to go with the bicycle commuting theme because I am a bicycle commuter and wanted to share my joy. I learned in this project a bit about structuring content via JavaScript instead of relying on preset HTML. I was able to figure out how to do various things with this app, including styling those radio buttons and keeping track of changes that take place as users interact with the app and displaying those changes. I also was able to make the app dynamic in terms of how many questions there are per question.

Thanks for having a look around!
